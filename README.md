This classification project supports targeted blood donation drives by predicting future donors based on past donation patterns. Applied ensemble models with high precision-recall balance to prioritize likely contributors. Included feature importance charts and model explainability sections to support real-world application. This project aimed to predict whether a donor would donate blood in the next campaign at the university campus. After conducting thorough data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis, various machine learning models were implemented to make predictions. The Gradient Boosting model outperformed others, achieving the highest accuracy and overall performance, with strong precision, recall, and F1-scores. Key factors influencing the donation behaviour included donation frequency, recency, and total volume donated. Despite challenges such as data quality issues and model performance, effective solutions like outlier removal, hyperparameter tuning, and feature selection were applied to enhance the modelâ€™s reliability. Based on the results, the Gradient Boosting model is recommended for predicting future blood donations.
